    "input": "",
    "output": "The standard EMI calculation formula is E = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1), where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the tenure in months.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain how the monthly interest rate is derived for EMI computation.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The monthly interest rate (r) is calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12 and then dividing by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal value.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Define the relationship between loan tenure and the EMI amount.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "There is an inverse relationship between loan tenure and EMI; increasing the tenure reduces the monthly installment amount but increases the total interest payable over the loan life.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does an increase in the principal amount affect the calculated EMI?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "An increase in the principal loan amount results in a proportionate increase in the EMI, assuming the interest rate and the repayment tenure remains constant.",

  {
    "instruction": "Describe the components that constitute a standard EMI payment.",
    "input": "",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the impact of a higher interest rate on the EMI value?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A higher interest rate directly increases the interest component of the installment, thereby raising the total EMI amount for the same principal and tenure.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "How is the 'reducing balance method' applied to EMI calculations?",
    "input": "",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Does the EMI amount change if a partial prepayment is made?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A partial prepayment reduces the outstanding principal, which typically results in either a reduced EMI amount for the remaining tenure or a shortened tenure at the same EMI.",
    "intent_id": "EMI_CALCULATION_INFO"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What variables are required to perform an EMI calculation?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The three essential variables required for EMI calculation are the total principal amount, the applicable annual interest rate, and the total repayment period in months.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "How is the total interest payable over the loan tenure calculated?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The total interest payable is calculated by multiplying the EMI amount by the total number of months (tenure) and subtracting the original principal amount.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Specify the calculation logic for a 'Flat Interest Rate' EMI.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "In a flat interest rate calculation, interest is charged on the full principal amount for the entire tenure, without considering the periodic repayment of the principal.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the difference between EMI in arrears and EMI in advance?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "EMI in arrears is paid at the end of the month following disbursement, while EMI in advance (Step-up) requires the first installment to be paid at the time of disbursement.",
    "intent_id": "EMI_CALCULATION_INFO"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does the frequency of compounding affect the EMI calculation?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Most retail loans use monthly compounding; more frequent compounding intervals would result in a higher effective interest rate and a higher EMI amount.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Are processing fees included in the EMI calculation?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Processing fees are typically one-time upfront charges and are not included in the EMI calculation unless they are added to the principal loan amount.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the effect of a 'moratorium period' on EMI computation.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "During a moratorium, EMIs are deferred, but interest usually continues to accrue and is added to the principal, resulting in higher EMIs once the repayment begins.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the formula for calculating the total repayment amount?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The total repayment amount is the sum of the principal and the total interest, determined by the formula: Total Amount = EMI × Number of Installments.",

    "instruction": "Define 'Fixed Rate EMI' logic.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A Fixed Rate EMI is calculated using an interest rate that remains constant throughout the entire loan tenure, ensuring the EMI amount does not fluctuate.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe the calculation adjustment for 'Floating Rate' EMIs.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "For floating rates, the EMI is recalculated whenever the benchmark lending rate changes, affecting either the installment amount or the remaining repayment tenure.",
