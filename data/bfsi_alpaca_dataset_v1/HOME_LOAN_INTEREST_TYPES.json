  {
    "instruction": "Explain the functioning of a fixed interest rate for a mortgage.",
    "input": "",

  {
    "instruction": "How does a floating interest rate mechanism work in home financing?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Floating interest rates are linked to a benchmark rate, such as the Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) or MCLR, and adjust periodically based on market fluctuations.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Define the hybrid or semi-fixed interest rate model.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A hybrid interest rate remains fixed for a specific initial period, such as three to five years, and then automatically transitions into a floating rate for the remaining tenure.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe the impact of market volatility on floating rate home loans.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "In a floating rate model, market volatility leads to periodic resets of the interest rate, which may result in an increase or decrease in the loan tenure or EMI amount.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Are there different reset periods for floating interest rates?",
    "input": "",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Identify the components of a floating interest rate calculation.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The floating interest rate is calculated by adding a credit spread or margin, determined by the bank's risk assessment, to the base benchmark rate.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Does the principal repayment change in a fixed rate loan?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "In a fixed rate loan, the interest rate is static, meaning the proportion of principal and interest within the EMI remains predictable according to the original amortization schedule.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is meant by the term 'spread' in floating rate home loans?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The spread is the additional percentage points charged above the benchmark rate, which remains constant unless a material change in the borrower's credit profile occurs.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the concept of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).",
    "input": "",
    "output": "An adjustable-rate mortgage is a loan where the interest rate is periodically adjusted based on a pre-defined index that reflects the cost of funds in the market.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What are the characteristics of a 'Dual Rate' home loan?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Dual rate loans offer a low fixed interest rate for the initial years of the loan, which subsequently increases or switches to a floating rate for the later years.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How is the MCLR linked interest rate different from RLLR?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "MCLR is an internal benchmark based on the bank's cost of funds, while RLLR is an external benchmark directly linked to the Reserve Bank of India's repo rate.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Are fixed interest rates usually higher than floating rates?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Fixed interest rates are generally set at a higher percentage than floating rates at the time of inception due to the elimination of interest rate risk for the borrower.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the frequency of interest rate revisions for RLLR loans?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Interest rates for RLLR-linked home loans are revised at least once every three months in accordance with changes to the RBI repo rate.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Detail the reset clause in a home loan agreement.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The reset clause defines the intervals at which the lender can review and adjust the floating interest rate based on the prevailing benchmark and bank policy.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the 'Step-up' interest rate feature?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Step-up interest rate structures involve lower initial interest rates or EMIs that increase at set intervals during the loan term, often aligned with expected income growth.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Define the 'Step-down' interest rate option.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A step-down interest rate structure starts with a higher EMI or interest payment that decreases over the tenure of the loan as the principal balance reduces.",
    "intent_id": "HOME_LOAN_INTEREST_TYPES"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does the bank determine the spread for a home loan?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The spread is determined based on the loan amount, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the credit risk category of the applicant at the time of sanction.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What happens to a fixed rate loan if the repo rate decreases?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A fixed rate loan remains unaffected by decreases in the repo rate, as the interest rate is locked in at the time of the loan agreement for the specified duration.",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Does the interest rate type affect the total cost of the loan?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The interest rate type determines how interest is accrued over time; fixed rates offer cost certainty, while floating rates can decrease or increase the total interest paid.",

  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Cap' in some floating rate agreements?",
    "input": "",
